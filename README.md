# Where in the world

In this project I have combined my JS, HTML and CSS knowledge to create a application that interacts with the https://restcountries.com/ REST API to display a range of countries and some facts about them.

I have implemented the Bootstrap Framework and also added the ability to search for a specific country by name with the results to update live as you type.
